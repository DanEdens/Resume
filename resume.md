    I created QRcode sticker generator that embeds a number and a status into a (Join)[https://joaoapps.com/join/]  webhook, that is recieved by a tablet located in the Geo-Insturments Shop.  
    I created a GUI for the tablet and backend to log unit events.  
    This was used to manage the desulfating schedule.  
    
    These batterys are used in various datalogger enclosures and rented out to clients.  
    When solar proves not enough, this batterys need to be desulfated, and possibly recycled.
