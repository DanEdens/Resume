1. What is your proudest achievement?
My proudest achievement is my journey to becoming a software developer. I embarked on my software learning path with a newborn baby in the house while working overtime in a physically demanding job. Carving out moments to study amidst my other responsibilities was a significant challenge. I am immensely proud of my determination to stay focused and master the skills necessary to create tools that enhance my life. 
My true pride lies in knowing I've optimized my time and developed a method of learning that works best for me.

1. Who are your role models? Why?
One of my biggest role models over the last few years has been a Software Engineer named Jeremy Tregunna. I've followed his startup studio's journey to bring a data-secure Therapy AI chatbot to market. He is passionate about making a difference in teen suicide prevention. His insights on client-focused design and marketing philosophy have led me down several new learning paths. We also share a love of Neovim and building mechanical keyboards!

Another significant role model in my life is my father. He is a Structural/Geotechnical Engineer and the most level-headed person I've ever met. It's nearly impossible to upset him because that doesn't help him to solve the problem at hand. 
He has taught me how to look at the big picture and has instilled in me the value of patience and respect when communicating.

1. What defines a work day for you?
I'm a morning person and like to hit the ground running. However, I recognize that problems don't simply vanish when the "Clock chimes". 
As a Father of two, I'm aware that I will occasionally need flexibility. With this in mind, I've made considerable efforts to retain my digital effectiveness while minimizing disruptions to my family during "off-hours".   
 Testing and automation often involve asynchronous processes. Adjustments or restarts may be necessary at varying intervals, and I leverage the latest technologies to minimize disruption. 

Having worked environmental diaster response, I've seen that sitting on a (problem, data, bug) until morning can be.. well Disastrous.  
At the end of the day, The client's "Show will go on". 
A little extra effort is the key to repeat business.  


1. How do you set and achieve your goals?
I am an evangelist for version control and build idea's much the same way I build software. When faced with a new project, I start off with a readme, where I define the goal and begin to story any reference material. I find Git commit messages the best way to record my thoughts about why I made a change, and the History makes it concrete. Building in "public" often helps me stay true to my personal time tables.

I have a recent recommendation that I'm 

"His attention to detail and 100% percent effort were noticeable to even a casual passerby. On days where most of the staff was working remotely or had taken the day off, I would routinely find Dan at his workstation, troubleshooting some technical issue, getting ahead on future work, or solving new and exciting problems."
