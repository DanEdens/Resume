Mobile Automation is a passion of mine. I have 10 years of experience in Testing and 5 years in Test Automation and DevOps best practices.

I have extensive experience designing and building tests to ensure functionality on a wide range of platforms, including React, Web, Embedded Linux, Android, and iOS. Automation means more than just product testing to me; I have roadmapped, designed, and implemented several small apps to increase workplace automation and ensure a better product experience for my past clients. Currently, I am working on a Mojo Revival of the Home Automation Platform, Eventghost, that I hope will pique your interest and showcase my dedication and passion for discovering the best tools to get the job done.

I have created and managed test case repositories for leading brand Motorola Routers, as well as performed lab and field testing for large-scale and sensitive projects. I will bring transparency and reliability to confidently enhance the product, with extensive experience working with Jenkins and similar platforms. I have both hardware and software testing experience.

I have worked for 1 year with Jira and have 4 years of experience with Azure DevOps Boards, which serve a similar function. I am a driven and relentless self-study, dedicating every effort to automating my life as much as possible. I couldn't be more excited about the chance to introduce automation enhancements to workflows. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my experiences can enhance your team's endeavors.
