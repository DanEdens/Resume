who am i 

I've worked in construction Monitoring and Testing for the last 5 years. 
I've gotten to setup networks in alot of really wild list of places including dams, extreme heights, refinerys, and even the alamo.  
I'm a going on 6 year Automation Junkie, I love to interconnect things that have no business being connected, 
I only ever ask "can we", and am happy to push "should we" up the chain.
I love to script everything so I'm flexible with staying on top of what i need to do, while doing what i want to do.

Family is really important to me, I have 2 kids, My son Jim is 10, and my Daughter Lily is 5.
we're all gamers together, we play alot of indie rhythm games, and roblox. 
My son likes to make skins for characters and 3d models for his games.
My daughter loves to build and decorate, and has been using the voice keyboard to teach herself how to read. 


why minim?%
%
because when I read the job ad, I had to make sure my resume didn't sound like I'd copied the ad and sent it right back.
It really just felt like I'd found the right fit, as soon as I read it. 
It combined when I'd done professionally with what I do with controlling devices for fun.


my hobbies

I have recently been really into VR devolpment, and am working on a plugin for a mind mapping app called Noda, 
that creates nodes from a mqtt pipe, tieing it into all my other systems.

I've taken a break from it, but I run a discord channel where i help teach people to build bots and autoclickers for games.

I also really enjoy hiking and exploring historical places with my wife, who is a big history buff
