Automation isn't just a job to me; I bring DevOps into my everyday life and enjoy exploring the best ways to utlize these tools.
 I constantly strive to offload my mental load and turn everything I do into a hassle-free and reusable script. I've learned a lot of what I know by building game automation and bots to allow me to keep my edge while also maintaining other duties. Bringing the two worlds together would be truly a dream scenario and I'm confident I can provide the value you're seeking.

I will bring transparency and reliability to confidently enhance the product, with 5 years of experience working with Jenkins and similar platforms. I have both hardware and software testing experience. During my time with Geo-Instruments (which consisted of maintaining sensor networks on construction sites and data management), I gained experience leveraging AWS and CI/CD assets to ensure continuous data collection and facilitate the rollout of new features while working in high-risk environments.

I am thrilled to express my deep enthusiasm for this opportunity.  My career has been marked by a relentless commitment to going the extra mile and introducing automation enhancements to workflows, and I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my experiences can enhance your team's endeavors.

I have:
5+ years of experience in DevOps
5+ years working with Jenkins or equivalent automation system
Competence with C# and several similar languages
Proven track record working with Teams and writing documentation
A relentless Can-do attitude and a strong desire to empower my team through Automation
I am local to Boston, and have citizenship
